# Comments from 1:1 demo

1. Flask app. 
2. Currently having an issue with date conversion in python to mongo query.
3. Currently the query is not returning any results over the specified date range; suspicion is that it has to do with iso date conversion.
4. query works in mongo shell, but mongo shell is javascript, not python.
5. Has a dashboard going, but the values in the plots are static at this moment (due to above mentioned query issue).
5. Dashboard is supposed to show counts of positive/neutral/negative sentiment comments on twitter and on youtube comments over the selected date range
